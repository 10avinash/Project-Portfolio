# Project in a Nutshell
The goal of this project is to estimate the financial effects of interlocked directors. A director is interlocked when he serves on the boards of two or more companies. Director boards network is formed with nodes as companies and edge weight as number of common (interlocked) directors.
After the formation of director boards network we calcualte associate centrality measures, and study the realtionships of various centrality with different financial performance indicators.
