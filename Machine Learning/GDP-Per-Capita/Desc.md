# Description
Due to increased industrialisation we have seen monetary gains which have been almost unparalled in history.
However, this has also resulted in increased greenhouse emissions. In this experiment, I utilize data on greenhouse gas emissions for GDP per 
GDP per capita prediction.  
The main results
- Model isn’t training, the training loss is too high even after thousands of epochs.
- Turns out, LSTM needs thousands of data points, anything in the hundreds won’t seem to do the trick.
