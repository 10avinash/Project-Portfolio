# Description
Inspired by [this](https://blog.statsbot.co/time-series-prediction-using-recurrent-neural-networks-lstms-807fa6ca7f) blog, I decided to implement 
my own LSTM and other ANN architectures for India-US Exchange rate prediction. This project really helped me in learning about data processing and
visualisation. Please take a look at the [code](https://github.com/10avinash/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Exchange_Rate_Prediction/Exchange.ipynb) and [presentation](https://github.com/10avinash/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Exchange_Rate_Prediction/Exchange%20Rate.pdf) [here](https://github.com/10avinash/Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Exchange_Rate_Prediction).
